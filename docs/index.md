# 🚀 AI Learning Roadmap: The Path to AGI

> "The best way to predict the future is to invent it." — Alan Kay (and every AGI researcher)

Welcome to the **hardcore** mission to master Artificial Intelligence. This roadmap is designed with a **First Principles** approach, stripping away the noise to focus on the fundamental physics of intelligence and its practical application.
