## 🛡️ Best Practices | 最佳实践

- **First Principles**: Don't just copy code. Understand the underlying math.
- **Fail Fast**: Experiment frequently. If a model doesn't work, figure out *why*.
- **Share**: If you build something cool, open a PR and contribute it to the lab!

> 🚀 **Mission Statement**: To bridge the gap between AI theory and real-world impact.
