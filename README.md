## 🛠️ The Mission Architecture | 任务架构

We don't do "shallow learning." We follow **First Principles**.

    A[00. Physics of Math] --> B[01. Silicon & Hardware]
    B --> C[02. The Transformer Core]
    C --> D[03. Local Intelligence]
    D --> E[04. Prompt Engineering]
    E --> F[05. RAG & Fine-tuning]
    F --> G[06. AI Agents & Autonomy]
    G --> H[07. Safety & Alignment]
    H --> I[🚀 AGI Ready]
```

### 🔭 Why This Roadmap?
1. **Hardcore Foundation**: From Linear Algebra to CUDA.
2. **AI-Native Workflow**: Use AI to learn AI. 
3. **Global Deployment**: Real-world strategies for shipping globally.
4. **Bilingual Support**: Built-in TTS for English and Chinese.
